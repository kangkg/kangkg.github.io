  <p>I wanted to talk about <i>memes</i> today.</p>
  <p>A <i>meme</i> is defined as "a humorous image, video, piece of text, etc. that is copied (often with slight variations) and spread rapidly by Internet users." <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/meme">[Credit to www.dictionary.com]</a></p>
