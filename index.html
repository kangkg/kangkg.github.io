  <h1>Hello there DBC!</h1>
  <p>I wanted to talk about "memes" today.</p>
  <p>A "meme" is defined as "a humorous image, video, piece of text, etc. that is copied (often with slight variations) and spread rapidly by Internet users." <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/meme"></a>(Credit to dictionary.com)</p>
