  <h1>Kenneth Kang's Index Page</h1>
  <p>I wanted to talk about a serious topic: <i>memes</i>.</p>
  <p>A <i>meme</i> is defined as "a humorous image, video, piece of text, etc. that is copied (often with slight variations) and spread rapidly by Internet users." <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/meme">[Credit to www.dictionary.com]</a></p>

  <h3>One of the most well known memes is the <i>RickRoll</i>.</h3>
  <p><img src="images/rickroll.gif" alt="Rick Astley dancing!" /></p>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">You've probably been <i>RickRolled</i> before!</a>

* Notes to self:<br>

* some content that mixes header and paragraph tags<br>
* at least one image<br>
* at least two block-level elements that give semantic meaning to content<br>
* a table or form (you can submit to httpbin if you like, or to the other page of your site)<br>
* a list<br>
* at least one additional page that is linked from index.html<br>
* Find an existing website about your topic (or similar). What makes this site good or bad? Look at the source code (View Source). Do you recognize any HTML elements? Try to guess what the things you don't recognize do. Add a link to this website and a few sentences about what makes it good or bad to your index.html page.
