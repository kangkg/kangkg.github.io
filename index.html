    <p>I wanted to talk about a <b>serious</b> topic: <em>memes</em>.</p>
    <p>A <em>meme</em> is defined as "a humorous image, video, piece of text, etc. that is copied (often with slight variations) and spread rapidly by Internet users." <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/meme">[Credit to www.dictionary.com]</a></p>

  <section>
    <h2>One of the most well known memes is the <em>RickRoll</em>.</h2>
    <p><img src="images/rickroll.gif" alt="Rick Astley dancing!" /></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">[Picture Credit to www.youtube.com]</a></p>
    <p>
    <h2>Some facts about the RickRoll:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The RickRoll is an internet phenomenon where a person often humorously pranks someone else by linking them the above Youtube video.</li>
        <li>The song is "Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley.</li>
        <li>It was made in 1987, and it was actually a number one hit on numerous international charts!</li>
        <li>It was reported that in 2010, the song had been played over 39 million times. Sadly, Astley only received $12 USD in royalties from Youtube, as his performance share.</li>
